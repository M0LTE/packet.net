# NinoTNC pair — measured characterisation

This document captures empirical measurements from the back-to-back NinoTNC
pair (audio-cross-wired, USB-attached) on the dev host. Numbers are
calibration data — they help us pick sensible defaults, evaluate adaptive
algorithms, and detect regressions. They are **not** universally
applicable: real RF links have noise, voltage standing wave ratios that
shift over temperature, multi-path, etc. that this benchtop setup has
none of.

Method: [`tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike`](../tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike/Soak.cs)
`soak` sub-commands. Reports land under `artifacts/nino-tnc-soak/<ts>/`.
Last campaign: 2026-05-14 `soak marathon` run.

## Hardware

- Two NinoTNC N9600A boards.
- Connection: USB-CDC ACM to the dev host (Windows 11). VID/PID
  `04D8:00DD` (Microchip USB-CDC reference design).
- Audio: TX↔RX cross-wired between the boards (cable, no RF stage).
- MODE DIPs: `1111` ("Set from KISS"). All mode selection via
  `KISS SETHW` from software with the `+16` non-persist offset.
- TXDELAY pots: minimum. KISS TXDELAY parameter is therefore honoured.
- Firmware: 3.44 (board-reported via TX-Test frame).

## Headlines from the 2026-05-14 marathon

### Mode compatibility (1200 AFSK → 19200 4FSK)

All seven candidate modes round-trip cleanly on the bench audio
cross-wire:

| Mode | Name | bps | A↔B success | Mean RTT ms (A→B / B→A) | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 6 | 1200 AFSK AX.25 | 1200 | 5/5 both | 1225 / 664 | the historical packet-radio mode |
| 7 | 1200 AFSK IL2P+CRC | 1200 | 5/5 both | 1411 / 1138 | IL2P-framed at AFSK rates |
| 12 | 300 AFSK AX.25 | 300 | 99/100 + 100/100 | 2579 / 2600 | see [§Mode 12 deep dive](#mode-12-deep-dive--what-the-5-frame-sample-missed) |
| 0 | 9600 GFSK AX.25 | 9600 | 5/5 both | 912 / 878 | legacy G3RUH-style 9600 |
| 2 | 9600 GFSK IL2P+CRC | 9600 | 5/5 both | 509 / 374 | recommended modern 9600 |
| 3 | 9600 4FSK | 9600 | 5/5 both | 935 / 746 | 4FSK at 9600 |
| 1 | 19200 4FSK | 19200 | 5/5 both | 510 / 297 | fastest mode in the catalog |

**For real-RF interop tests, plan for mode 6 (most lenient) or mode 2
(good 9600 baseline).** The audio cross-wire is high-bandwidth enough
to support every mode; on a real FM-voice link the higher modes are
out of reach.

### Mode 12 deep dive — what the 5-frame sample missed

The marathon's 5-frame mode-12 row read "4/5 A→B" and got flagged as
flaky. With N=100 per direction, the truth is:

| TXDELAY | A→B success | B→A success | Failure indexes |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 20 ms | 99/100 | 100/100 | A→B index 0 |
| 50 ms | 99/100 | 100/100 | A→B index 0 |
| 100 ms | 99/100 | **4/100** | A→B index 0 ; B→A 0, 5–99 |

Payload-size sensitivity at TXDELAY=50, N=50 per row:

| Payload bytes | A→B | B→A |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | 49/50 | 50/50 |
| 20 | 50/50 | 50/50 |
| 50 | 50/50 | 50/50 |
| 100 | 50/50 | 50/50 |
| 200 | 50/50 | 50/50 |

Two real findings, distinct from "mode is flaky":

1. **First-frame-after-SetMode artefact.** In every A→B run across
   every TXDELAY tried, the failure is the same: the very first frame
   (index 0) is lost. Every other frame in the run is fine. The 700 ms
   post-`SetMode` settle this probe uses is *not* enough to guarantee
   the first frame is received on the partner. The
   `tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike` `ack-warmup-probe` shows the same
   first-frame fragility at mode 6 when there's a backed-up TX queue.
   Both point at "warm up the modem before the first measured frame"
   as the right discipline for tests and the session layer.

2. **TXDELAY=100 ms + mode 12 once produced a catastrophic B→A
   failure** (4/100 succeeded; frames 5–99 all lost in a contiguous
   run). This pattern is **not reproducible on demand** — two follow-
   up probes (one at N=50 across modes 12/13/14, one re-running the
   original probe verbatim) saw mode 12 at TXDELAY=1000 ms come back
   to 49/50 / 50/50 with only the first-frame artefact. The original
   break may be: a thermal / electrical transient; a specific
   accumulated state in the modem firmware that this probe sequence
   doesn't reliably trigger; or an interaction with some other
   process on the host that one run hit. **Mode 13 (AFSKPLL IL2P)
   and mode 14 (AFSKPLL IL2P+CRC) at the same TXDELAY=1000 ms are
   100/100 clean** — neither shares mode 12's vulnerability, even
   though they share the 300 baud air time. Whatever the original
   pathology was, it appears specific to mode 12's AFSK-without-PLL
   demod path. **The conservative rule remains: keep TXDELAY ≤ 50
   on mode 12** — at 50 ms the link is reliable, at 100 ms it's
   either reliable or catastrophic with no apparent middle.

Payload size has **no effect** on mode-12 failure rate. The earlier
small-sample "flaky" finding is fully explained by the first-frame
artefact above.

See `artifacts/nino-tnc-mode12/<timestamp>/report.md` for raw data;
re-run with `dotnet run --project tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike --
mode12-probe COM6 COM8`. Cross-mode comparison at 300 baud
(`slow-mode-probe`) lives under
`artifacts/nino-tnc-slow-modes/<timestamp>/report.md`:

| Mode | Demod / framing | TXDELAY=500 ms | TXDELAY=1000 ms |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 12 | AFSK / AX.25 | 49/50 A→B (first only), 50/50 B→A | 49/50 A→B (first only), 50/50 B→A |
| 13 | AFSKPLL / IL2P | 49/50 A→B (idx 9), 50/50 B→A | 50/50 both |
| 14 | AFSKPLL / IL2P+CRC | 50/50 A→B, 49/50 B→A (first only) | 50/50 both |

### Per-mode TXDELAY floor

Walking TXDELAY down a ladder `{50, 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1}` per
mode, 10 frames each direction:

| Mode | Name | bps | Min TXDELAY 10/10 | Min ms | Note |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 6 | 1200 AFSK AX.25 | 1200 | 1 | 10 | |
| 7 | 1200 AFSK IL2P+CRC | 1200 | 1 | 10 | |
| 12 | 300 AFSK AX.25 | 300 | — | — | breaks at TXDELAY=50 with 9/10 |
| 0 | 9600 GFSK AX.25 | 9600 | 1 | 10 | |
| 2 | 9600 GFSK IL2P+CRC | 9600 | 1 | 10 | |
| 3 | 9600 4FSK | 9600 | 1 | 10 | |
| 1 | 19200 4FSK | 19200 | 1 | 10 | |

The KISS spec default of TXDELAY=50 (500 ms) is **50× over-conservative
on this audio path**. Six of the seven modes maintain 100 % success at
TXDELAY=1 (10 ms). Mode 12 is the odd one out: 9/10 even at the
spec default, suggesting a mode-specific demod issue rather than a
preamble-length issue.

On real RF this floor will rise significantly (transmitter key-up
delays, receiver AGC + sync acquisition). The adaptive estimator's
job is to discover the *actual* per-link minimum, not to use the
spec-default.

### Payload size sweep (mode 6)

| INFO bytes | A→B success | A→B mean ms | B→A success | B→A mean ms |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 5/5 | 528 | 5/5 | 814 |
| 16 | 5/5 | 1169 | 5/5 | 616 |
| 64 | 5/5 | 1467 | 5/5 | 1112 |
| 128 | 5/5 | 1571 | 5/5 | 1486 |
| 200 | 5/5 | 2120 | 5/5 | 1993 |
| 230 | 5/5 | 2386 | 5/5 | 2173 |

The 230-byte frame's air time at 1200 bps is `(230 + 17 header + 2
FCS) * 8 / 1200 ≈ 1.66 s`. RTT of ~2.4 s allows ~700 ms for TX-delay
+ key-up + receive-side decode + ACK echo — consistent with the
slower TXDELAYs we used here.

### Binary payload (KISS escape stress)

30 frames of pseudo-random AX.25 INFO bytes biased to ~60 % `0xC0` /
`0xDB` / `0xDC` / `0xDD` (FEND/FESC/TFEND/TFESC), to exercise the KISS
escape path through the actual driver and modem:

- **30/30 (100 %) round-trip success.** Escape coding is solid.

### Sustained throughput, ACK-paced

20 frames of 200-byte AX.25 INFO sent A→B in ACKMODE: each
`SendFrameWithAckAsync` awaits the TX-completion echo before the next
is queued. TXDELAY=5 (50 ms) on every mode.

| Mode | Frames | All ACKed? | Effective B/s | Efficiency |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 6 (1200 AFSK AX.25) | 20 | yes | 87 | 58 % |
| 7 (1200 AFSK IL2P+CRC) | 20 | yes | 78 | 52 % |
| 12 (300 AFSK AX.25) | 20 | yes | 34 | 91 % |
| 2 (9600 GFSK IL2P+CRC) | 20 | yes | 346 | 29 % |

**Finding:** the ACK-pacing pattern is the right one for the
session-layer integration. Every frame ACKs on the first try at
TXDELAY=50 ms, so the only overhead per frame is the TX-DELAY +
slot-time + per-frame ACK-echo round-trip. Mode 12 (300 AFSK)
shows the best efficiency because its per-frame air time is large
relative to that fixed overhead; mode 2 (9600 GFSK) shows the
lowest because the per-frame air time is much shorter than the
fixed overhead.

**Earlier finding, retracted:** a non-paced version of this test
bursted Data frames without awaiting completion; on three of four
modes it delivered ~0 % of the frames because the TNC silently
queued and (under sufficient pressure) dropped them. That number is
**not** representative of the modem's actual throughput — it's a
property of unmanaged-queue behaviour. The session-layer integration
must use ACK-pacing or some other queue-depth control.

### High-volume stress, ACK-paced (mode 6, TXDELAY=5)

200 sequential ACK-paced frames at the lowest reliable TXDELAY:

- **200/200 (100 %) success.**
- Round-trip ms: min 1166, p50 1600, p95 2443, p99 2763, max 2970.

p99 within ~2× of p50 — well-behaved tail.

### ACKMODE concurrency

Multiple ACKMODE frames in flight simultaneously, mode 6:

| N concurrent | All echoed? | Total elapsed s | Min ms | Mean ms | Max ms |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | yes | **15.03** | 15029 | 15029 | 15029 |
| 2 | yes | 0.45 | 222 | 335 | 447 |
| 4 | yes | 0.91 | 226 | 560 | 891 |
| 8 | yes | 1.81 | 226 | 1001 | 1773 |

**Resolved post-marathon:** the soak's `throughput` sub-command runs
just before `ackmode-concurrent`, bursting 20 frames at the modem
without ACK pacing. The TNC silently queues frames it can't transmit
immediately. When `ackmode-concurrent`'s first measured frame is
submitted, its ACKMODE echo correctly waits for every previously-
queued frame to drain off the TX queue first — that's ~15 s of
1200 AFSK at 200 bytes per frame.

The `tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike` `ack-warmup-probe` sub-command
reproduces this on demand:

```
Scenario 5: Open + SetMode + 20 back-to-back Data frames + ACKMODE
  first ACK (after burst): 17 467 ms
  second ACK:                  213 ms
```

The other four scenarios (vanilla, long settle, prime-with-data,
prime-with-ack) all return the first ACK in **228–857 ms**. The 15 s
is not a firmware initialisation cost; it is the modem's TX queue
draining correctly.

**Implication:** the driver / session layer should treat ACKMODE
elapsed time as a *true* TX-completion measure, not a queueing
measure. If you `await Send(...)` and care about TX completion, use
`SendFrameWithAckAsync`. Don't burst plain Data frames followed by
"how long did the next one take" — that measures the queue, not the
modem.

### Bidirectional simultaneous send (half-duplex CSMA contention)

10 rounds of A and B sending the same instant, TXDELAY=20:

- **9/10 rounds both peers received the other's frame.**

CSMA + the modem's built-in deferral does its job. PERSIST=63 /
SLOTTIME=10 ms defaults are good enough for two-station contention.

### Adaptive estimator (`TxDelayHillClimbEstimator`) — live run

40 frames with aggressive tuning (`SuccessesPerStepDown=3`,
`StepUnits=2`, `MinTxDelay=2`) starting from TXDELAY=50:

- All 40 ACKMODE round trips succeeded.
- Estimator walked TXDELAY 50 → 24 across the 40 frames (reproducible
  across runs).
- Final 240 ms is still wildly above the 10 ms floor — the algorithm
  is conservative. For production on a stable benchtop link, tune
  `StepUnits` higher or `SuccessesPerStepDown` lower; for production
  on real RF, the current cadence is sensible (frame-loss penalty is
  +10 units, so 5 consecutive non-losses to recover from one bad
  frame).

### Long-idle stability

2-minute idle watch with both modems open and in mode 6:

- 0 spurious inbound frames on either side.
- 0 driver pump errors.

The driver is quiet when there's nothing to do.

## Caveats

- **Single host, single setup.** Findings reflect the dev box's specific
  USB ports and one audio cable. Different USB controllers may produce
  different TXDELAY floors.
- **No noise, no fading, no real radios.** The bench audio cross-wire
  is artificially clean. **Adaptive TXDELAY tuning is essentially
  unexercised here** — every mode hits the 10 ms floor and the
  estimator has no failures to ratchet against. The estimator's value
  shows up when there are real transmitters with hundreds of ms of
  key-up delay, real receivers needing meaningful preamble for AGC
  and sync, and conditions that drift over time. **The numbers in this
  document are a benchtop floor, not a tuning target.**
- **Firmware v3.44.** Future firmware may change TX behaviour.
- **Avoid TXDELAY=100 on mode 12.** It breaks the receiver under
  sustained traffic in one direction. See the deep-dive section
  above. Other TXDELAY values (≤ 50) at mode 12 are fine.

## How to re-run

```sh
$env:PACKETNET_NINOTNC_PORTS = "COM6,COM8"
dotnet run --project tools/Packet.NinoTnc.Spike -- soak marathon COM6 COM8
```

Output lands under `artifacts/nino-tnc-soak/<timestamp>/results.md`.
The `soak` tool has narrower sub-commands too (`mode-sweep`,
`txdelay-sweep`, `payload-sweep`, `throughput`, `ackmode`,
`bidirectional`, `idle`, `estimator-live`, `stress`,
`per-mode-txdelay`, `binary-payload`).
